![Banner Image Placeholder](https://github.com/romizb/Big-Floof-Energy/blob/main/jasmine%20banner.jpg)
## Objective summary

The aim of this project is to create a python based, user-friendly, web application to streamline dog care and management among roommates. This application will allow roommates to collaboratively organize tasks such as walking, feeding, and providing water for the dog. The program will also integrate web scraping features to track discounts on dog food from various e-commerce websites, as well as be able to supply weekly reports as CSV files containing data on completed tasks and spending on dog food. 

---
## How to install

The project will upload as a web-based platform accessible from any device with an internet connection. Therefore, no software installation required for users. However, a login in profile will be needed.

---
## How to run test for project

The body of the project will be written in python, therefor the test will be as a module in VSCode.

---
## How to supply data

Data will be supplied by the users through the web based platform. Data will then be stored in SQLite (to lesser metadata), and data summaries in CVS files.

## Workflow
1.	**Requirements Analysis and Design**
-	Define user requirements and design the layout.
-	Outline the database schema and application architecture.
2.	**Core Functionality Development (aka collaboration tool)** <img align="right" width="235" height="300" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d47b655c-9538-4e50-ba98-53faee59a488">
-	Implement user authentication and profile management.
-	Implement task logging, calendar features and availability planner features.
3.	**Web Scraping Module**
-	Build web scraping scripts to monitor dog food discounts.
-	Store scraped data in the database and implement notification logic.
4.	**Testing and Debugging**
-	Test modules in VSCode.
-	Let friend run the code, debug and optimize the code for performance.
-	Add FAQ to README repository of the project on GitHub.
5.	**Deployment**
-	Prepare the final application for standalone use.
-	Deploy the application online.
